* Install [ur_rtde](https://sdurobotics.gitlab.io/ur_rtde/)

### Evaluation (üñ•Ô∏è Basic)
Under project root (i.e. `irp/`), create `data` folder and download [IRP Rope Dataset](#datasets) as well as [Pretrained Models](#pretrained-models). Extract tar files

```
$ cd data
$ tar -xvf checkpoints.tar
$ tar -xvf irp_rope.zarr.tar
```
Activate environment
```
$ conda activate irp
(irp) $
```
Run dataset evaluation script. Use `action.gpu_id` to select GPU on multi-GPU systems.
```
(irp) $ python eval_irp_rope_dataset.py action.gpu_id=0
```

A `log.pkl` file will be saved to the ad-hoc output directory created by [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). Add command-line argument `offline=False` to enable wandb logging (recommended).

Numbers reported in our paper is generated using this method.

### Evaluation (üëæ Simulation)
Extract data and checkpoints following [basic](#evaluation-üñ•Ô∏è-basic) (required).
Install dependencies following [sim installation](#installation-üëæ-simulation).

Run simulation evaluation script.
```
(irp) $ python eval_irp_rope_dataset.py action.gpu_id=0
```

Note that this method has not been extensively tested and is mainly provided for future development. Mujoco might crash due to numerical instability (i.e. Nan), which is better handled in the dataset.

### Evaluation (ü¶æ Real Robot)
Extract data and checkpoints following [basic](#evaluation-üñ•Ô∏è-basic) (required).
Install dependencies following [real installation](#installation-ü¶æ-real-robot).

Initialize UR5 robot and write down `<robot_ip>`. Move robot in teach mode close to joint configuration `[-90,-70,150,-170,-90,-90]` to prevent unexpected movement.

Run `ur5_camera_calibration_app` to create homography calibration file to `data/calibration.pkl`. Use `A/D` keys to move `j2` and `W/S` keys to move `j3`. Click on the tip of the wooden extension for calibration.
```
(irp) $ python ur5_camera_calibration_app.py --ip <robot_ip> -o data/calibration.pkl
```
Example for calibration result, the red and blue crosses should be fairly close.

Run real eval script.
```
(irp) $ python eval_irp_rope_real.py
```
Result and videos will be saved to the hydra ad-hoc output directory.

### Training
To train IRP model from scratch:
```
(irp) $ python train_irp.py
```

In case of inaccurate tracking, use `video_labeler.py` to generate tracking labels and `train_tracker.py` to train tracking model.
